# Flask-Project
This repository contains a simple Data Management System implemented using Flask and SQLite.
The project consists of several HTML templates for user interfaces and a main Python file (Apps.py) responsible for managing the data.
This project showcases the use of Flask, SQLite, and HTML to create a simple yet functional database-driven web application. The different components work together to demonstrate the principles of data storage and retrieval.
